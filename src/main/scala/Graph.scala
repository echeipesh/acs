 * Design choices:
 * 1. The Graph manages the weight updates.
 *  This is sufficient for the base implementation and keeps the messages both small and immutable.
 *  A more flexible alternative would be to accept Travel(from, to, f:Edge=>Edge) and use f for update.
 *  As long as f does not close over parent Actor scope it would be safe to use.
 *
 * 2. The graph is basically a matrix, which is a little silly because it might as well be triangle matrix
 *  But in reality this is not the most efficient approach either way and will be refectored when it matters.
